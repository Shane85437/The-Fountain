# Relativity of Precausality

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the "Relativity of Precausality" project, a theoretical framework unifying gravitational, cosmological, and quantum dynamics through an operator-valued stress-energy tensor. The model explores emergent gravity, dark sector unification, and the resolution of key tensions (e.g., Hubble, \(\sigma_8\)) using MCMC analyses and consistency checks.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Develop and validate a novel grand unified theory linking black hole entropy, cosmic acceleration, and quantum decoherence.
- **Key Components**: 
  - MCMC implementations (Bilby, emcee, Cobaya) for parameter constraints (\(\chi\), \(\ell\)).
  - Theoretical tests (solar system, fifth force, neutrinos, LSS, Sgr A* IMBH prediction).
  - LaTeX draft of the paper and supporting figures.
- **Status**: Pre-publication; work in progress with ongoing refinement
