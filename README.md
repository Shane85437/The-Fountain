# Relativity of Precausality

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the "Relativity of Precausality" project, a theoretical framework unifying gravitational, cosmological, and quantum dynamics through an operator-valued stress-energy tensor. The model explores emergent gravity, dark sector unification, and the resolution of key tensions (e.g., Hubble, \(\sigma_8\)) using MCMC analyses and consistency checks.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Develop and validate a grand unified theory of quantum gravity linking black hole entropy and cosmic acceleration, unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity.
- **Key Components**: 
  - MCMC implementations (Bilby, emcee, Cobaya) for parameter constraints (\(\chi\), \(\ell\)).
  - Theoretical tests (solar system, fifth force, neutrinos, LSS, Sgr A* IMBH prediction).
  - LaTeX draft of the paper and supporting figures.
- **Status**: Pre-publication; work in progress with ongoing refinement

# Relativity of Precausality

This repository explores a unified theory of gravity, cosmology, and quantum dynamics. It leverages MCMC analyses (Bilby, emcee, Cobaya) and consistency checks to resolve key tensions (H_0, σ_8) and predict Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs). This is pre-publication research.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Unify black hole entropy, cosmic acceleration, and quantum decoherence under a novel framework.
- **Components**: 
  - MCMC implementations for parameter constraints (χ, ℓ).
  - Theoretical tests (solar system, fifth force, neutrinos, LSS, Sgr A*).
  - LaTeX draft and supporting figures.
- **Status**: Work in progress, pre-arXiv submission.
