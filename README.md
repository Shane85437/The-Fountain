# Relativity of Precausality

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the "Relativity of Precausality" project, a theoretical framework unifying gravitational, cosmological, and quantum dynamics through an operator-valued stress-energy tensor. The model explores emergent gravity, dark sector unification, and the resolution of key tensions (e.g., Hubble, \(\sigma_8\)) using MCMC analyses and consistency checks.

## Overview

### 🎯 Purpose
Develop and validate a **grand unified theory of quantum gravity** linking **black hole entropy** and **cosmic acceleration**,  
unifying **quantum mechanics** and **general relativity** under a single causal operator framework.
